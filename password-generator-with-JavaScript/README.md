# Password Generator Using JavaScript

The password generator is a basic project in learning JavaScript. This is a basic project but needs some understanding of JavaScript. Creating this project taught me to implement functions that are used to generate lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol into a single text. The advantage of this password manager is the program is already adjusted with the newest OWASP module that takes at least 8 characters when creating a password. Happy Hacktoberfest.
